# Using the **run_analysis.R** script
The **run_analysis.R** script collects, cleans and summarizes the test and train data found [Here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).

Clicking the above link will download **UCI HAR Dataset.zip** which needs to be unzipped to be used.

To use the **run_analysis.R** script, you must start it from the directory where you unzipped and installed the file.

The *UCI HAR Dataset* directory should be in the working directory.

After the analysis, the file **AverageBySubjectActivity.txt** contains the tidy data set with averages of all the variables grouped by subject and activity.
